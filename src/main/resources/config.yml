# ITEM FORMAT:
# @url: the URL of the texture to be used (@material should be PLAYER_HEAD).
# @material: the material of the item.
# @model-data: the custom model data id, used for custom resource packs.
# @display_name & lore: self-explanatory.
# @crafting.shaped: whether the item recipe is shaped (like WORKBENCH) or not (like FLINT_AND_STEEL).
# @crafting.ingredients: the ingredients that'll be used for the recipe. Format: MATERIAL_NAME, KEY (used for shape, see below).
# @crafting.shape: the shape that'll be used on the crafting table, using the KEY specified (only 3 lines required, spaces are used as AIR).
# @flags: which attributes to hide.
# @enchantments: the enchantments to be applied.
# @leather-color: the color of the leather armor.
# * Use a color from: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Color.html (e.g. AQUA, BLACK, etc.)
# * Use a random color with: $RANDOM
# * Use a color using RGB format: &#RRGGBB
# @damage: the amount of damage to apply to the item (maximum durability - given damage, can be $RANDOM or X-Y).
# @tipped: the potion effect the arrow will have (must be a TIPPED_ARROW).
# @amount: the amount of items.
#
# $RANDOM:
# Color: a random color. (@leather-color)
# PotionType: a random potion effect. (@tipped)
# For @damage, a random value between 1 and max item durability is used.
#
# RANGED AMOUNT (X-Y): A random value between x and y. (@amount / @enchantments (level))
#
# PERCENTAGE (only valid for @damage, NOT DECIMAL): X% / %X (% must be included); for example, 50% (same as %50) would be half-damage.
# NOTE: The percentage is taken from the maximum durability; this means:
# * WOODEN_SWORD max durability = 60; if @damage is 50% (60 * 0.50) → 30. If @damage is 25% (60 * 0.25) → 15.
# That value will be the damage added to the item; so, if @damage is %25, the new durability of the WOODEN_SWORD will be 60 - 15 = 45.
#
# In this example, the required ingredients are 7 of GOLD_INGOT and 1 of DIAMOND.
# You can use spaces to represent AIR (nothing).
# Ingredients:
#   - DIAMOND, D
#   - GOLD_INGOT, G
# shape:
#   - "GDG"
#   - "G G"
#   - "GGG"

# Here you can modify the vehicle item obtained by using {/vwasd give} and the characteristics of each vehicle.
#
# Each vehicle can have a crafting recipe (If you don't want them to be crafted, simply remove the @{crafting} section).
# More information on how to create a craft at the beginning of the configuration file.
#
# @min-speed: the minimum reverse speed.
# @max-speed: the maximum forward speed.
# @acceleration: the acceleration speed; The higher it is, the faster the speed limits will be reached.
#
# For the helicopter @{down-speed} replaces @{min-speed}, which will be the descent speed of the helicopter.
# @{up-speed} is the helicopter's ascent speed.
# @{max-speed} as before, is the forward speed.0
# NOTE: Helicopters cannot move backwards.
#
# All vehicles can have fuel, although boats have it disabled by default.
# To remove fuel from a vehicle, set @{max-fuel} = 0.0.
# To add or modify a vehicle's fuel, you must add @fuel.max-fuel (maximum fuel capacity) and @fuel.reduction-per-second (reduction amount per second).
#
# All vehicles can have engine sounds, refueling sounds, and starting and stopping sounds.
# You can specify the sound, volume and pitch (separated by "," or " ").
# NOTE: 2: The engine sounds for the boats will only sound when the boat is moving.
#
# The storage can have between 1 and 6 rows. If left at 0, the vehicle storage will be disabled.
# NOTE 3: If you reduce the number of rows, any items left outside will be lost. It is RECOMMENDED that you adjust this before giving players access.
# For example, If the bikes had a @{storage-rows} of 3 rows, and you change it to 2, the items in the deleted third row will be lost (the same if you set it to 0).
